## 1. Executive Summary  
Over the first full year of ownership (Q1–Q4 2025), the 16-unit property at 1625 E 21st St delivered stable occupancy and steadily improved cash flow relative to our original pro forma.  

- **Occupancy:** Ended Year 1 at 95% (on target).  
- **Effective Gross Income (EGI):** Under-budget by \$3,040 in Q1, but exceeded pro forma by \$1,460 in Q3; Q4 came exactly in line.  
- **Net Operating Income (NOI):** 7.4% below pro forma in Q1, but ended the year exactly on target.  
- **Cash Flow to Equity:** \$1,976 (18.3%) below pro forma in Q1, but caught up by Q4.  
- **Debt Service Coverage (DSCR):** Started at 1.56× in Q1, climbed to 1.74× in Q3, and ended at 1.68×—in line with our 1.68× target.  

No major repairs were required beyond our \$1,500/unit reserve, and all quarterly metrics either met or exceeded expectations by year-end.

> **Notes on Variances:**  
> - **Q1 underperformance** is attributable to two units remaining vacant longer than planned, which directly reduced EGI, NOI, and cash flow.  
> - **Q2 & Q3 overperformance** reflects higher-than-budgeted rent bumps and fewer expense overruns. In Q3, we executed three small rent increases (\$25–\$50/unit) on renewals, boosting EGI by \$1,460.  
> - **Q4 hit pro forma exactly** as lease-up was complete and expenses normalized.

**Q1:**  
- Lease-up took longer (2 units vacant until late February)  
- \$2,500 emergency HVAC repair on one unit (funded from CapEx reserve)

**Q2:**  
- Early capture of modest rent bumps: raised rents \$25/month on five renewals  
- Occupancy climbed from 90% to 92% by quarter end  
- Operating expenses remained within budget (no major unplanned repairs)  

**Q3:**

- One unit turned over smoothly; new tenant executed full-market lease in Q3  
- All exterior landscaping completed (budget: \$4,000)  

**Q4:**

## 5. Investment Commentary & Outlook  

1. **Occupancy & Leasing:**  
   - **Year 1 closed at 95% occupancy**, exactly matching our underwriting assumption.  
   - **Lease-up delays in Q1** were expected in a small transitional market; by aligning rental concessions correctly, we regained ground in Q2 and Q3.  

2. **Expense Management:**  
   - **Q1 HVAC repair** (\$2,500) was covered by our CapEx reserve without dipping into operating cash flow.  
   - **Landscaping and exterior maintenance** remained on budget, with \$5,000 total spent in Year 1 (versus \$6,000 budgeted).  

3. **Rent Growth & Revenue:**  
   - **Q2 rent bumps** (+\$25/mo average) and **Q3 rent bumps** (+\$50/mo average) outperformed our 2% annual growth target.  
   - **Q3 EGI** topped pro forma by 3.6%, demonstrating room to push rents if occupancy stays above 93%.  

4. **Debt Service Coverage:**  
   - **All quarters** maintained **DSCR > 1.56×**, well above our 1.25× threshold.  
   - With an average **1.67× DSCR** in Year 1, the property can comfortably weather moderate vacancy or small expense overruns in Year 2.  

5. **Cash Flow & Returns:**  
   - **Year 1 Cash Flow to Equity:** \$42,520, which is \$488 below our pro forma year-end target of \$43,008.  
   - **Average Cash-on-Cash Yield for Year 1:** ~11.1%, driven by higher Q2/Q3 performance.

## 6. Key Risks & Mitigations (Year 2 Focus)  

| Risk / Concern                                   | Mitigation Plan                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sustaining Rent Growth**                       | Continue targeting 2% annual rent bumps—plan to test market in Q1 2026 with two units (similar \$50/mo bump). |
| **Vacancy Spikes in Off-Season**                 | Launch winter-season lease promotion (e.g., \$25 gift card for leases signed in January/February). |
| **Major CapEx (Roof / HVAC Aging)**              | Roof is scheduled for inspection in Q2 2026; budgeting \$15,000 for potential partial roof repair. |
| **Operating Expense Creep**                      | Negotiate new multi-year landscaping/maintenance contract by end of Q1 2026 saving ~\$500/year. |
| **Local Job Market Slowdown**                    | Explore short-term student leases in coordination with IUPUI housing office to offset any downtown job losses. |

## 7. Action Items & Next Steps  

1. **Q1 2026 Rent Bump Audit (Jan 2026):**  
   - Target two end-of-lease units for \$50/mo increases if local comps support.  
   - Reassess market rents quarterly via Zillow/Rent.com to stay competitive.  

2. **Q2 2026 Roof & HVAC Inspection:**  
   - Engage a qualified inspector to assess life expectancy; allocate \$15,000 in reserves if partial repair is needed.  

3. **Occupancy Push (Off-Season):**  
   - Roll out targeted winter promotion (e.g., 4 months free amenities for leases signed in Jan/Feb).  
   - Partner with a local university housing coordinator for mid-year turnovers.  

4. **Long-Term Budget Review (May 2026):**  
   - Update Year 2 pro forma to reflect actual Year 1 performance:  
     - Increase expense ratio from 35% to 36% based on Year 1’s lower landscaping costs but higher HVAC reserve.  
     - Adjust rent growth assumption to 2.5% if market rent trends remain strong.  

5. **Investor Communication (Monthly Email):**  
   - Provide brief snapshot of rent roll changes, occupancy, and any maintenance highlights.  
   - Next in-depth report scheduled at the end of Q2 2026.
