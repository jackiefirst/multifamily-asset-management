## 3. Market Overview
- **Submarket:** Near Eastside of Indianapolis. A mix of working-class and entry-level professional renters.  
- **Rent Trends:**  
  - 2 BR units rent for $850–$950/month in this submarket. $900/month used as “market average.”  
  - Year-over-year rent growth has averaged ~2–3% in the last 2 years.  
- **Supply/Demand:**  
  - Vacancy in this area hovers around 5–6%, driven by IUPUI students and young professionals.  
  - No major new apartment deliveries nearby in the past 18 months, so upside if occupancy improves.  
- **Comparable Sales:**  
  - 2023 sale: 12-unit building (3 BR/1 BA) closed at $630,000 ($52,500/unit, 5.2% cap).  
  - 2024 sale: 20-unit building (mix of 1–2 BR) closed at $1,500,000 ($75,000/unit, 5.0% cap).  
- **Economic Drivers:**  
  - Marion County unemployment ~3.8% (slightly above national average).  
  - New mixed-use developments near downtown bringing in ~1,000 new jobs over next 2 years.  
  - Proximity to IUPUI (student demand) and to a light-manufacturing corridor that employs local labor.

## 4. Investment Thesis
1. **Below-Market Basis / Value Add Potential**  
   - Purchase price of $1,260,000 for a fully leased 16-unit at a 5.0% cap in mid-2025 is ~$10,000/unit below recent 20-unit sale.  
   - Modest interior and exterior refresh (paint, flooring, landscaping) can drive rents +$50–$75/unit/mo to align with top-of-market, unlocking incremental NOI. Even a $600/unit annual bump in rent across all units adds ~$9,600 in cash flow/year.

2. **Stable Cash Flow with Conservative Underwriting**  
   - Using a 5% vacancy assumption and 35% expense ratio yields Year 1 NOI of $106,704.  
   - Debt service at 6%, 30-year, produces $63,456/year, leaving $43,248 of cash flow to equity in Year 1 (~3.6% cash-on-cash).  
   - Rent growth of 2%/year should offset inflation and provide growing equity returns, with DSCR >1.3x throughout hold.  

3. **Long-Term Equity Growth**  
   - Projected 10-year IRR of ~5.09% and equity multiple of ~2.32× (assuming conservative exit cap of 5.5%) captures both cash flow and appreciation.  
   - Indianapolis, while slower growth than coast, yields a more stable, lower-volatility environment, ideal if you intend to hold for >7 years.

4. **Opportunity to Scale**  
   - If this model is repeatable, you can acquire similar mid-sized value properties in submarkets of Indianapolis or nearby cities (e.g., Fort Wayne, Muncie) and aggregate a small portfolio, optimizing management fees and lowering capex costs through economies of scale.

## 6. Key Risks & Mitigants

| Risk                                            | Mitigant                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prolonged Vacancy >5%**                       | Aggressive leasing plan: partner with a local property manager (PM) with strong tenant demand.   |
| **Rent Growth Under 2%**                        | Indianapolis rent growth has historically ranged 2–3%.  Consider modest $25/unit/mo renewal bump. |
| **CapEx Costs Over Budget (Aging Systems)**     | Inspect roof/HVAC before close. Build $1,500/unit CapEx reserve (~$24k) for first 2 years.     |
| **Interest Rate Shock (Refinance Risk)**         | If refinance occurs at higher rate, hedge with partial interest rate lock at 50% of loan.         |
| **Local Economic Downturn**                     | Diversify tenant base: 50% working professionals, 50% students. Explore modest retail lease on ground floor if zoning allows. |
