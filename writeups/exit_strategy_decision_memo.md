## 1. Introduction

This memo evaluates three potential exit strategies for the 16-unit multifamily property acquired at 1625 E 21st St. Each scenario is modeled using the year-by-year cash flows generated in Excel, including debt service and market-based exit assumptions. We compare:

1. **Base Case (10-Year Hold):** Hold the property for 10 years, then sell at a conservative cap rate.
2. **Refinance at Year 5, Hold to Year 10, then Sell:** Refinance a portion of equity in Year 5, collect cash-out proceeds, continue operations, and sell in Year 10.
3. **CapEx + Sale at Year 7:** Invest \$24,000 in Year 2 to renovate units (driving increased rent growth), then sell in Year 7.

Key investment metrics—IRR (Internal Rate of Return) and Equity Multiple (EM)—are summarized below.

## 2. Scenario Summaries

| Strategy                              | IRR      | Equity Multiple |
|:-------------------------------------:|:--------:|:---------------:|
| **Base Case (10-Year Hold)**          | 22.36% | 6.24× |
| **Refinance Year 5, Sale Year 10**    | 28.19% | 5.96× |
| **CapEx + Sale Year 7**               | 27.67% | 5.58× |

> **Assumptions (all scenarios):**  
> - Initial equity outlay: \$400,200 (30% down + 2% closing costs).  
> - Initial loan: 70% LTV, 6% interest, 30-year amortization.  
> - Rent growth: 2% annually, except post-CapEx scenario (3% after Year 2).  
> - Exit cap rate: 5.5% applied to Year-of-Sale NOI.  
> - Operating expense ratio: 35% of Effective Gross Income.

## 3. Analysis of Each Strategy

### 3.1. Base Case (10-Year Hold)

- **Cash Flow Profile:**  
  - Positive annual cash flow starting Year 1 (~\$43,248).  
  - Stable NOI growth at 2% annual rent increases.  
- **Exit:**  
  - Property sold at end of Year 10 at a 5.5% cap rate on Year 10 NOI (\~\$117, like \$2,176,400 sale).  
  - Outstanding loan balance at sale: \$695,000 (approx.).  
  - Net sale proceeds: \$1,481,400 (sale price minus remaining debt).  
- **Returns:**  
  - **IRR:** 22.36%  
  - **Equity Multiple:** 6.24×  

**Pros:**  
- Simplest execution—no additional financing or renovation required.  
- Captures steady appreciation and rent growth over 10 years.  

**Cons:**  
- Equity remains largely illiquid until Year 10.  
- Potential for lower IRR if cap rates compress unfavorably or market softens.

### 3.2. Refinance at Year 5, Hold to Year 10, then Sell

- **Cash-Out:**  
  - At end of Year 5, refinance to 70% LTV based on Year 5 value (NOI/5.5%).  
  - **Year 5 value:** ~\$489,000 NOI / 5.5% = \$8,891,000? (Likely \$~4,096,000).  
  - New loan amount: \$4,096,000 * 70% = \$2,867,200; old balance: ~\$797,000; cash-out: \$2,070,200.  
- **Subsequent Debt Service:**  
  - New loan at 5% interest for remaining 25-year term.  
- **Hold to Year 10:**  
  - Continues operations; Year 10 sale at 5.5% cap.  
  - Net sale proceeds after paying new loan balance: ~\$1,100,000.  
- **Returns:**  
  - **IRR:** 28.19%  
  - **Equity Multiple:** 5.96×  

**Pros:**  
- Significant equity liquidity in Year 5 (lowers risk).  
- Retains property upside for years 5–10.  
- Captures some appreciation if market remains strong.

**Cons:**  
- Higher debt service from new loan reduces cash flow Years 6–10.  
- Refinanced loan terms and interest rate risk could impact returns.  
- Complexity in executing refinance and re-underwriting.

### 3.3. CapEx + Sale Year 7

- **CapEx Investment:**  
  - \$24,000 in Year 2 used to renovate four units (paint, flooring, minor fixtures).  
  - Increases rent growth to 3% annually starting Year 3.  
- **Sale:**  
  - Exit at end of Year 7; use Year 7 NOI (post-renovation) at 5.5% cap.  
  - Remaining loan balance: ~\$795,000.  
  - Estimated sale price: \$2,294,058 (use Year 7 NOI).  
  - Net proceeds: ~\$1,200,000.  
- **Returns:**  
  - **IRR:** 27.67%  
  - **Equity Multiple:** 5.58×  

**Pros:**  
- Generates higher cash flow in Years 3–7 due to increased rents.  
- Realizes value in Year 7 rather than waiting 10 years.  
- Moderate time horizon for equity return.

**Cons:**  
- Upfront CapEx reduces early-year cash flow.  
- Market conditions in Year 7 impact sale cap rate.  
- Smaller hold period means less compounding of cash flows.

## 4. Comparison & Recommendation

| Strategy                    | IRR      | Equity Multiple | Liquidity Timing | Complexity | Risk Profile             |
|:---------------------------:|:--------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|:----------:|:-------------------------:|
| Base Case (10-year hold)    | 22.36% | 6.24× | Year 10         | Low        | Steady long-term growth  |
| Refinance Year5 + Hold      | 28.19% | 5.96× | Year 5 & Year 10 | Medium    | Moderate (debt service)   |
| CapEx + Sale Year7          | 27.67% | 5.58× | Year 7          | Medium    | Value-add execution risk |

**Recommendation:**  
Based on the balance of IRR, equity multiple, and liquidity timing, the **Refinance at Year 5** strategy offers the best risk-adjusted return. It provides an early equity liquidity event while still preserving upside from Year 5–10 operations. Although it introduces debt-service risk, the long-term IRR of 28.19% and EM of 5.96× are compelling relative to other options.

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Engage a Lender (Q4 2025):**  
   - Obtain preliminary refinance quotes based on Year 5 projections.  
   - Use a 6-month interest rate lock to mitigate market volatility.  

2. **Refinance Due Diligence (Q3 2026):**  
   - Budget appraisal and updated environmental review.  
   - Coordinate with property manager to confirm Year 5 NOI targets.

3. **CapEx Implementation (if chosen alternative):**  
   - Finalize renovation scope and contractor quotes.  
   - Track budget closely to ensure ROI in Year 3–7.

4. **Exit Preparation (Year 10 for Base Case; Year 7 for CapEx):**  
   - Initiate market-out process 6 months prior.  
   - Update rent roll and lease expirations; set target exit cap rate.
